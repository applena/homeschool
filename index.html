                  “It is so annoying to have to wait for all the other kids to catch up,” my daughter’s friend tossed
                  out in
                  the
                  middle of their conversation. “School is so boring!”
                </p>

                <p>
                  I could feel the energy in my child shift. See the fire in her eyes. This was not the first time my
                  daughter
                  and I had encountered this attitude towards education and it wouldn't be the last.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Coming from the perspective of a classroom teacher with a masters in education, I can confidently say
                  that
                  the
                  idea of a “gifted” class of students is one of the most detrimental ideas that has permeated our
                  educational
                  system.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let’s set aside how broken the system is for identifying “gifted” students. How affluent white
                  families
                  are
                  much more likely to have the time and resources to advocate for their child to be tested. How the test
                  for
                  a
                  “gifted” student is nothing more than an IQ test which is deeply flawed in itself. Let’s assume that
                  we
                  are
                  somehow able to magically identify all the “gifted” students and label them as such.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What then? At best, we have identified a group of students who pick up on certain concepts quickly. It
                  doesn’t
                  mean that they already know the material being presented. They still need to learn just like everyone
                  else.
                </p>

                <p>
                  School is not a race. School is not a race. School is not a race.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the advent of standards based education, we have inadvertently turned school into a race. A goal
                  post
                  to
                  reach for and exceed. We have completely lost sight of the true value of education which is to spark
                  curiosity
                  and critical thinking about the world around us. By saying that all students should know x, y, and z
                  by
                  this
                  age, you end up with one group of students who say, “well, I knew x, y, and z last year so therefore I
                  am
                  smarter than you.” While another group of students think “this is hard, and everyone says that I
                  should
                  know
                  it, so something must be wrong with me.” Neither of these statements are true.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The truth is that every kid is going to learn at their own pace. I can’t tell you how many times well
                  meaning
                  teachers and administrators have tried to push my child ahead when she simply wasn’t ready for it. I
                  don’t
                  need my child to skim through fractions, decimals, place value - the principles that all math is based
                  on
                  - so
                  that she can take calculus by high school. In the long run a solid understanding of the basics of math
                  will
                  serve her a lot better than a class in calculus which she will probably forget in a year anyway. Plus,
                  if
                  she
                  takes the time to really understand what is happening with all those numbers, she is much more likely
                  to
                  find
                  joy in that process later than if she is rushed through each class in a crazy bid to “keep up”.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the flip side, for those students that are “so bored”, what a brilliant opportunity to dive deep
                  into
                  the
                  subject. Really spark their curiosity about how these simple concepts work. One of my favorite
                  examples of
                  this is done by a woman named Vi Heart and I highly recommend you watch her videos.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By removing the goal post of “how fast can I do this” and replacing it with “how deeply can I explore
                  this” we
                  change the whole goal of education from a “race to finish” to a chance to find something that sparks
                  your
                  interest and explore it more deeply.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was always at the top of my class. I remember being proud that I not only had I completed calculus,
                  but
                  I
                  was tutoring other students in the subject. English, science - all very similar stories. When I
                  graduated
                  college and started looking for a job, being at the top of my class, finishing first in everything
                  mattered
                  exactly zero. I no longer had someone telling me what to do, pushing me to take the next step. In the
                  real
                  world, the skills I needed were the very skills that had been trained out of me during my educational
                  years.

                <p>
                  Working together with my coworkers
                  Waiting to move forward on something until everyone understood
                  Diving deep into one area rather than racing ahead to cover as many areas as possible
                </p>

                <p>
                  What a disservice we are doing to our gifted children to teach them that the road to success is to
                  breeze
                  through things, covering as much ground as possible while leaving others behind. This skill set will
                  not
                  serve
                  them in the real world. That feeling of superiority, owning that label of “gifted” can only hurt them
                  with
                  their relationship building to the other “non-gifted” coworkers they now find themselves surrounded
                  with.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My daughter struggles with math and numbers. However, the biggest hurdle that she has to overcome is
                  the
                  constant reminder that she is not doing math at the same level as her peers. Not the challenge of
                  solving
                  a
                  problem. Not even the way numbers seem to move around in her head. The biggest challenge is that she
                  compares
                  herself to others her age. Despite our constant conversations and my encouragement, she feels deep
                  shame
                  that
                  she is not “good enough”. The fact that she is not at this imaginary goal post is actively getting in
                  the
                  way
                  of her learning about and enjoying numbers. Think about that. The very way in which we measure success
                  is
                  actively interfering with that success.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I homeschool my child so that she can take the time and space to dive into concepts that she wants to
                  know
                  more about. To take her time exploring new ideas without the fear that her peers are looking down on
                  her.
                  I
                  honestly believe that every child should have this opportunity but until we do a drastic overhaul of
                  our
                  school system and remove these harmful labels, I have very little hope that things will change.
