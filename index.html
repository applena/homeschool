                  “It is so annoying to have to wait for all the other kids to catch up,” my daughter’s friend tossed
                  out in
                  the
                  middle of their conversation. “School is so boring!”
                </p>

                <p>
                  I could feel the energy in my child shift. See the fire in her eyes. This was not the first time my
                  daughter
                  and I had encountered this attitude towards education and it wouldn't be the last.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Coming from the perspective of a classroom teacher with a masters in education, I can confidently say
                  that
                  the
                  idea of a “gifted” class of students is one of the most detrimental ideas that has permeated our
                  educational
                  system.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let’s set aside how broken the system is for identifying “gifted” students. How affluent white
                  families
                  are
                  much more likely to have the time and resources to advocate for their child to be tested. How the test
                  for
                  a
                  “gifted” student is nothing more than an IQ test which is deeply flawed in itself. Let’s assume that
                  we
                  are
                  somehow able to magically identify all the “gifted” students and label them as such.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What then? At best, we have identified a group of students who pick up on certain concepts quickly. It
                  doesn’t
                  mean that they already know the material being presented. They still need to learn just like everyone
                  else.
                </p>

                <p>
                  School is not a race. School is not a race. School is not a race.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the advent of standards based education, we have inadvertently turned school into a race. A goal
                  post
                  to
                  reach for and exceed. We have completely lost sight of the true value of education which is to spark
                  curiosity
                  and critical thinking about the world around us. By saying that all students should know x, y, and z
                  by
                  this
                  age, you end up with one group of students who say, “well, I knew x, y, and z last year so therefore I
                  am
                  smarter than you.” While another group of students think “this is hard, and everyone says that I
                  should
                  know
                  it, so something must be wrong with me.” Neither of these statements are true.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The truth is that every kid is going to learn at their own pace. I can’t tell you how many times well
                  meaning
                  teachers and administrators have tried to push my child ahead when she simply wasn’t ready for it. I
                  don’t
                  need my child to skim through fractions, decimals, place value - the principles that all math is based
                  on
                  - so
                  that she can take calculus by high school. In the long run a solid understanding of the basics of math
                  will
                  serve her a lot better than a class in calculus which she will probably forget in a year anyway. Plus,
                  if
                  she
                  takes the time to really understand what is happening with all those numbers, she is much more likely
                  to
                  find
                  joy in that process later than if she is rushed through each class in a crazy bid to “keep up”.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the flip side, for those students that are “so bored”, what a brilliant opportunity to dive deep
                  into
                  the
                  subject. Really spark their curiosity about how these simple concepts work. One of my favorite
                  examples of
                  this is done by a woman named Vi Heart and I highly recommend you watch her videos.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By removing the goal post of “how fast can I do this” and replacing it with “how deeply can I explore
                  this” we
                  change the whole goal of education from a “race to finish” to a chance to find something that sparks
                  your
                  interest and explore it more deeply.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was always at the top of my class. I remember being proud that I not only had I completed calculus,
                  but
                  I
                  was tutoring other students in the subject. English, science - all very similar stories. When I
                  graduated
                  college and started looking for a job, being at the top of my class, finishing first in everything
                  mattered
                  exactly zero. I no longer had someone telling me what to do, pushing me to take the next step. In the
                  real
                  world, the skills I needed were the very skills that had been trained out of me during my educational
                  years.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Working together with my coworkers
                  Waiting to move forward on something until everyone understood
                  Diving deep into one area rather than racing ahead to cover as many areas as possible
                </p>

                <p>
                  What a disservice we are doing to our gifted children to teach them that the road to success is to
                  breeze
                  through things, covering as much ground as possible while leaving others behind. This skill set will
                  not
                  serve
                  them in the real world. That feeling of superiority, owning that label of “gifted” can only hurt them
                  with
                  their relationship building to the other “non-gifted” coworkers they now find themselves surrounded
                  with.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My daughter struggles with math and numbers. However, the biggest hurdle that she has to overcome is
                  the
                  constant reminder that she is not doing math at the same level as her peers. Not the challenge of
                  solving
                  a
                  problem. Not even the way numbers seem to move around in her head. The biggest challenge is that she
                  compares
                  herself to others her age. Despite our constant conversations and my encouragement, she feels deep
                  shame
                  that
                  she is not “good enough”. The fact that she is not at this imaginary goal post is actively getting in
                  the
                  way
                  of her learning about and enjoying numbers. Think about that. The very way in which we measure success
                  is
                  actively interfering with that success.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I homeschool my child so that she can take the time and space to dive into concepts that she wants to
                  know
                  more about. To take her time exploring new ideas without the fear that her peers are looking down on
                  her.
                  I
                  honestly believe that every child should have this opportunity but until we do a drastic overhaul of
                  our
                  school system and remove these harmful labels, I have very little hope that things will change.

              <article>
                <p>When my daughter was born, I read every book I could get my hands on. I was determined to be the most
                  amazing mother ever. This precious small human deserved nothing less. </p>


                <p>Aside from the obvious books like 'What to expect...', I read books on attachment parenting, crying
                  it out, socializing your child, bonding with your child, the benefits of breastfeeding, the benefits
                  of bottle feeding. Until one day, when my daughter was about one, I couldn't take it anymore. I threw
                  the current book I was reading across the bathroom and cried.</p>


                <p>I know, that seems a little dramatic, but I was so determined to be the best mother possible and for
                  every book I read there was another book telling me to do the complete opposite. I looked at my
                  precious daughter and felt that beautiful rush of hormones that I can only describe as pure love.</p>


                <p>That was my first step. If the only thing that I could trust was that I loved this tiny human more
                  deeply than anything I had ever felt before, I would start with that. I threw out all my books - all
                  my parenting magazines - and leaned into what I thought I should do. It turned out that making that
                  decision was the hardest step. Once I decided to just love on this child, everything else seemed
                  obvious.</p>


                <p>I won't get into the details of how we raised our daughter when she was an infant. There are so many
                  ways to care for an infant that my choices at that stage were never questioned, and I was pretty much
                  doing what those around me were doing. It was when my daughter hit kindergarten that things got
                  interesting.</p>


                <p>At that stage of life, my daughter was called, "spirited", "strong-willed", "defiant", "bossy", "a
                  leader" and one professional even tried to label her with "oppositional defiant disorder". So,
                  needless to say, her early years were no walk in the park. I could have read books about raising this
                  sort of child - I know there are a lot of books out there to choose from - but I hung onto parenting
                  from this place of love. It seemed so simple, and I was beginning to trust myself. I encouraged my
                  daughter to test her limits - to see how high she could climb, to speak to kids and adults alike.</p>


                <p>We didn't believe in punishment. When my daughter did something like push another kid, we would talk
                  it out. Dive into how she was feeling and what the other kid might be feeling. My mother had taught me
                  Nonviolent-Communication growing up and I used this skill all the time raising my child. Her feelings
                  mattered. We treated her as a human being. Someone to be respected. This did not go over well with
                  other parents.</p>


                <p>My kid had a best friend in kindergarten who she adored. One day, out of the blue, her mom called me
                  and told me that she didn't want her child around my daughter anymore. That my daughter was a bad
                  influence. This was not the only phone call like that that I would receive over the years, but it was
                  the first. Other parents hated that I didn't punish my child. They thought I was too permissive, that
                  my daughter was too wild. Despite the loneliness and isolation this caused, I continued to parent the
                  only way that I knew how - from my heart - loving and supporting this beautiful human.</p>


                <p>Something magical happened when my daughter hit her teen years. All of that spirit and will that we
                  had nurtured rather than respressed transformed her into a person who knew who she was. While her
                  friends struggled to find themselves, my daughter slipped easily into her skin. She was still the
                  strong-willed human that she had always been but now she used that power to stand up for people who
                  were being picked on or marginalized. She came out as gay and fiercely protected those around her who
                  were being bullied.</p>


                <p>She had no trouble speaking with adults and by the time she was 15, she had three separate businesses
                  running. One of the most astounding things about my daughter, though, is the way she feels about me
                  and my husband. While her friends shun their parents and actively rebel, our daughter seeks us out.
                  She speaks with us about big things and little things. She wants to spend time with us. </p>


                <p>Treating her with respect has become even more important in her teen years. Many would still call us
                  permissive, but really I just see it as trusting our child. When she wants to do something, I see it
                  as my role to support her rather than putting arbitrary limits on her. When something isn't working in
                  our family, we all sit down together and brainstorm ways to make it work for everyone. No one is
                  allowed to leave a family meeting until everyone is happy. </p>


                <p>These days, I am told regularly that I am an amazing mother. People want their children to be friends
                  with my daughter because she is such a positive influence. I don't think that I did anything special
                  besides trusting my child. In a society where we are taught that we know what is best and must enforce
                  our will on our children, trusting my daughter was radical.</p>


                <p>There was one area where I began to question everything: education. I have a masters in teaching. I
                  know all the best teaching practices, but while my daughter sat in a public classroom doodling on her
                  arm, being taught by some amazing professionals, I couldn't help but feel something was wrong.</p>


                <p>Pulling her out of school was terrifying. I knew that I couldn't teach her. I valued our relationship
                  too much to put myself in that kind of authoritarian position so I signed her up for online classes.
                  She thrived. She loved the small classes online and the one-on-one interaction that they provided but
                  something was still off. My daughter was trying so hard to participate in some classes - like ELA -
                  while other classes like her horse veterinary class came easily.</p>


                <p>Listening in on her classes, I realized that much of what was being taught was actually pretty
                  pointless. I would have a hard time staying actively engaged as well. These were teachers who were
                  outstanding at what they did teaching to a class of two or three students. This was the best possible
                  option. What was feeling off.</p>


                <p>It all comes down to trust.</p>


                <p>When my daughter tells me that she doesn't really enjoy ELA, I have to trust her. Reading is such a
                  joy, but talking about a book for hours was killing her joy. What choice do I have? She has to take an
                  ELA class, right?</p>


                <p>The choice has become more and more clear. Our current system of education doesn't work. If I truly
                  trust my child, and I do, our only option is to throw this whole system of education out the window
                  and really spend time figuring out what makes her tick. Dive deep into those areas and stop wasting
                  time on the rest of it. The thing is - she isn't going to remember the theme from the book that she
                  was forced to read or the quadratic function that she had to memorize for a test, but she does
                  remember every bone in the horse's body and all the different ways that horses can get colic. </p>


                <p>I am once again embarking on a lightly treaded parenting footpath rather than staying the course on a
                  highway of known ideas. I am once again questioned and whispered about at parties, but I only really
                  know one thing and that one thing is that I love and trust my kid more than anything. </p>
